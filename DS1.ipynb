        "\n",
        "The developed expert system is a \"Drink Recommendation\" system.\n",
        "Its capabilities include:\n",
        "*   Categorizing user-provided temperatures into 'Cold', 'Moderate', or 'Hot'.\n",
        "*   Identifying and validating user-provided moods.\n",
        "*   Making specific drink recommendations based on a combination of categorized temperature and validated mood.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system performs simple decision-making by:\n",
        "1.  Receiving two inputs: an integer `temperature` and a string `mood`.\n",
        "2.  Categorizing the `temperature` into one of three predefined ranges.\n",
        "3.  Validating and normalizing the `mood` input.\n",
        "4.  Querying a predefined `knowledge_base` (a Python dictionary) using the categorized temperature and normalized mood as a tuple key.\n",
        "5.  Returning the corresponding drink recommendation if a match is found, or a default message if no specific rule applies, or an error message if the mood is unrecognized.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Domain Definition**: The expert system was defined as a \"Drink Recommendation\" system, taking `temperature` (integer) and `mood` (string) as inputs and providing a `recommendation` (string) as output.\n",
        "*   **Knowledge Base Structure**:\n",
        "    *   Temperature was categorized into 'Cold' (below 10°C), 'Moderate' (10-25°C), and 'Hot' (above 25°C).\n",
        "    *   Five mood categories were established: 'Happy', 'Sad', 'Tired', 'Energetic', and 'Relaxed'.\n",
        "    *   A Python dictionary named `knowledge_base` was used to store 15 distinct rules, mapping `(mood, temperature_category)` tuples to specific drink recommendations (e.g., `('Happy', 'Hot')` maps to 'Iced Tea').\n",
        "*   **Inference Engine Logic**:\n",
        "    *   A `categorize_temperature` function was implemented to map raw temperature inputs to their respective categories.\n",
        "    *   A `get_drink_recommendation` function was developed to process user inputs, normalize mood, validate moods against a predefined set, construct a query, and retrieve recommendations from the `knowledge_base`.\n",
        "*   **Decision-Making Capabilities**:\n",
        "    *   The system successfully provided appropriate drink recommendations for various valid inputs:\n",
        "        *   28°C and 'Happy' resulted in 'Iced Tea'.\n",
        "        *   15°C and 'Tired' resulted in 'Espresso'.\n",
        "        *   5°C and 'Sad' resulted in 'Coffee'.\n",
        "        *   30°C and 'Energetic' resulted in 'Sparkling Water with Lime'.\n",
        "        *   18°C and 'Relaxed' resulted in 'Chamomile Tea'.\n",
        "    *   It correctly handled unrecognized mood inputs, such as 22°C and 'sleepy', by returning an informative error message: \"Sorry, 'sleepy' is not a recognized mood. Please choose from Tired, Energetic, Happy, Sad, Relaxed.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The current expert system is highly rule-dependent. Future enhancements could involve implementing a more flexible rule engine that allows for dynamic rule addition or modification without direct code changes.\n",
        "*   To improve user experience, the system could incorporate fuzzy logic or a confidence score for recommendations, especially when multiple rules might partially apply or if user inputs are slightly outside defined categories.\n"
